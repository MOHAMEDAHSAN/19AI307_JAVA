# Ex.No:3(A)  STRING AND ITS OPERATIONS IN JAVA
## AIM:
To create a java program to read input and print length of the string in java.

## ALGORITHM :
1.  Start the Program.
2.	Import `Scanner` and define class `demo`
3.Create Scanner: A Scanner object is created to read data from the console.
4. Read String: The program reads an entire line of text (a string) that the user types.
5. Calculate Length: It then determines the number of characters (length) in the read string.
6. Print Result: Finally, it displays the calculated string length to the console.
