# Ex.No:4(D) FINAL & STATIC IN JAVA

## AIM:
   To create a Java program to perform final & static keyword for below situation Employee object contains member 'Emp_Id'. It contains object named name, which contains its own informations such as Fname, Mname, Lname.
 
## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the Program.
2.	Define squ Function: The program defines a way to calculate the area of a square. It takes one number (side) as input and returns that number multiplied by itself.
3.	Define rec Function: The program defines a way to calculate the area of a rectangle. It takes two numbers (l for length and b for breadth) as input and returns the product of these two numbers.
4. Start Main Program: The main part of the program begins.
5. Calculate and Show Square Area: The program uses the squ function with the side length 5 to calculate the area (5 * 5 = 25) and then prints "Area of Square is 25".
6. Calculate and Show Rectangle Area: The program uses the rec function with length 4 and breadth 3 to calculate the area (4 * 3 = 12) and then prints "Area of Rectangle is 12".
7.	End

## PROGRAM:

        return l*b;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args )
    {
        System.out.println("Area of Square is "+squ(5));
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle is "+rec(4,3));
