# Ex.No:6(E)  SWAPING VARIABLES 

## AIM:
To write a Java programs to swap the values of the two variables by without using a third variable. Get Input value from user.

## ALGORITHM :

1.	Start the program.
2.	Prepare Input: The program sets up to receive input from the user.
3.	Declare Variables: Two integer variables, a and b, are declared to store numbers.
4.	Read First Number: The program reads the first integer value entered by the user and stores it in variable a.
5.	Read Second Number: The program reads the second integer value entered by the user and stores it in variable b.
6.	Print Swapped Values: The program prints the values of a and b, but in a swapped order. It displays the value of b as the new value of a, and the value of a as the new value of b.
7.	End the program.

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a;
        int b;
        a = sc.nextInt();
        b = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("After swapping a= "+b+" b="+a);

## RESULT:
Thus, the java program demonstrates multiple inheritance using interfaces and successfully displays the mark sheet of a student by collecting personal and academic data.
