# Ex.No:8(E)  File Output Stream

## AIM:
Implement a Java Program to write a byte in a file "testout.txt" using FileOutputStream

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Open the file specified by 'filename' in append mode. This means new data will be added to the end of the existing file.
3.	Write the 'data' (the byte representing the ASCII value of 'A') to the opened file.
4.	Close the file to ensure the data is written and resources are released.
5.	Print the message "Successfully Completed" to the console.
6.	End the program


## PROGRAM:
 ```
/*
Program to implement a INPUT STREAM READER
Developed by: S Mohamed Ahsan
RegisterNumber:  212223240089

OutputStream f = new FileOutputStream("testout.txt",true);
f.write(65);
f.close();
System.out.println("Successfully Completed");

## RESULT:
Thus, the java program uses InputStreamReader to read input and handles loop termination based on the presence of # at the end of the input string, as specified.
